## 📁 Data Preparation

### Dataset Structure for Qwen-Image and FLUX Training

The training data should follow the same format for both Qwen and FLUX models, where each image has a corresponding text file with the same name:

```
dataset/
├── img1.png
├── img1.txt
```

### Dataset Structure for Qwen-Image-Edit Training

For control-based image editing, the dataset should be organized with separate directories for target images/captions and control images:

```
dataset/
├── images/           # Target images and their captions
│   ├── image_001.jpg
│   ├── image_001.txt
│   ├── image_002.jpg
│   ├── image_002.txt
│   └── ...
└── control/          # Control images
    ├── image_001.jpg
    ├── image_002.jpg
    └── ...
```
### Data Format Requirements

1. **Images**: Support common formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP)
2. **Text files**: Plain text files containing image descriptions
3. **File naming**: Each image must have a corresponding text file with the same base name

### Data Preparation Tips

1. **Image Quality**: Use high-resolution images (recommended 1024x1024 or higher)
2. **Description Quality**: Write detailed, accurate descriptions of your images
3. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent style and quality across your dataset
4. **Auto-generate descriptions**: You can generate image descriptions automatically using [Florence-2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gokaygokay/Florence-2)

### Quick Data Validation

You can verify your data structure using the included validation utility:

```bash
python utils/validate_dataset.py --path path/to/your/dataset
```

This will check that:
- Each image has a corresponding text file
- All files follow the correct naming convention
- Report any missing files or inconsistencies

## 🏁 Start Training on < 24gb vram

To begin training with your configuration file (e.g., `train_lora_4090.yaml`), run:

```bash
accelerate launch train_4090.py --config ./train_configs/train_lora_4090.yaml
```

## 🏁 Training

# Qwen Models Training

## Qwen-Image LoRA Training

To begin training with your configuration file (e.g., `train_lora.yaml`), run:

```bash
accelerate launch train.py --config ./train_configs/train_lora.yaml
```

Make sure `train_lora.yaml` is correctly set up with paths to your dataset, model, output directory, and other parameters.

## Inference: Diffusers Pipelines

We provide pipelines for easy inference. The following code demonstrates how to sample images from the distilled Qwen-Image model.

### [Glance (Qwen-Image)](demo/example_gmqwen_pipeline.py)
Note: GM-Qwen supports elastic inference. Feel free to set `num_inference_steps` to any value above 4.
```python
import torch
from diffusers import FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler
from lakonlab.pipelines.piqwen_pipeline import PiQwenImagePipeline

pipe = PiQwenImagePipeline.from_pretrained(
    'Qwen/Qwen-Image',
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
adapter_name = pipe.load_piflow_adapter(  # you may later call `pipe.set_adapters([adapter_name, ...])` to combine other adapters (e.g., style LoRAs)
    'Lakonik/pi-Qwen-Image',
    subfolder='gmqwen_k8_piid_4step',
    target_module_name='transformer')
pipe.scheduler = FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler.from_config(  # use fixed shift=3.2
    pipe.scheduler.config, shift=3.2, shift_terminal=None, use_dynamic_shifting=False)
pipe = pipe.to('cuda')

out = pipe(
    prompt='Photo of a coffee shop entrance featuring a chalkboard sign reading "π-Qwen Coffee 😊 $2 per cup," with a neon '
           'light beside it displaying "π-通义千问". Next to it hangs a poster showing a beautiful Chinese woman, '
           'and beneath the poster is written "e≈2.71828-18284-59045-23536-02874-71352".',
    width=1920,
    height=1080,
    num_inference_steps=4,
    generator=torch.Generator().manual_seed(42),
).images[0]
out.save('gmqwen_4nfe.png')
```
